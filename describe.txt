I can try to make it more complex by adding some features, such as:

Multiple choice questions with four options each
A timer to limit the time for each question
A score multiplier that increases with each correct answer and decreases with each wrong answer
A hint option that reveals one wrong option for each question
A quit option that ends the quiz at any time
